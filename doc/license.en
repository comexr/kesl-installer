The data obtained for processing depends on the product or service, and it is recommended that users carefully read the agreements and related statements accepted during installation or usage of software or service.
Some data are non-personal, according to laws of certain countries. Regardless of the type of data and territory where data was received or processed, we use the highest standards of data protection and apply various legal, organizational, and technical measures in order to protect user data, guarantee safety and confidentiality, as well as ensure users' rights guaranteed under applicable law.

The data depends on the products and services you use, and could include the following:

* License/ subscription information
It is processed in order to recognize legitimate users. This data is needed to maintain communication between the product and Kaspersky Lab services - sending and receiving product databases, updates, etc.

* Product information
Data on the product's operation and its interaction with the user is also analyzed. For example, how long does threat scanning take? Which features are used more often than others? Answers to these and other questions help developers to improve products, making them faster and easier to use.

* Device data
Data such as device type, operating system, etc. may be needed so the user doesn't have to buy a new license for the security product after reinstalling the operating system. This information also helps us to analyze cyberthreats, because it shows how many devices are affected by any specific threat.

* Threats detected
If a threat (new or known) is found on a device, information about that threat is sent to Kaspersky Lab. This enables us to analyze threats, their sources, principles of infection, etc., resulting in a higher quality of protection for every user.

* Information on installed applications
This information helps to create lists of harmless applications and prevents security products from mistakenly identifying such applications as malicious. This data is also used to update and extend program categories for features like Parental Control and Application Startup Control. In addition, this information helps us to offer users security solutions that best match their needs.

* URLs visited
URLs can be sent to be checked whether they are malicious. This information also helps to create lists of harmless websites and prevents security products from mistakenly identifying such websites as malicious. This data is also used to update and extend website categories for solutions like Kaspersky Safe Kids and provide better protection for financial transactions in such products as Kaspersky Fraud Prevention. In addition, this information helps us to offer users security solutions that best match their needs. Information about logins and passwords, if contained in the initial browser request from the user, is removed from the visited URL addresses up to the hostname or IP address. In any case, it is not Kaspersky Lab's purpose to process user logins and passwords, and Kaspersky Lab takes all reasonable and sufficient measures to avoid processing these data.

* Operating System events
New malware can often be identified only by its suspicious behavior. Because of this, the product analyzes data on processes running on the device. This makes it possible to identify early on processes that indicate malicious activity and to prevent any damaging consequences, such as the destruction of user data.

* Suspicious files and files that could be exploited by intruders
If an (as yet) unknown file, exhibiting suspicious behavior is detected on a device, it can be automatically sent for a more thorough analysis by machine learning-based technologies and, in rare cases, by a malware analyst. The "suspicious" category includes mainly executable files (.exe). For the purpose of reducing the likelihood of false positives, executable and non-executable files or their parts may be sent.

* Wi-Fi connection data
This information is analyzed in order to warn users of insecure (i.e., poorly protected) Wi-Fi access points, helping to prevent personal data from being inadvertently intercepted.

* User contact data
Email addresses are used for authorization on the Kaspersky Lab web portals (My Kaspersky, Kaspersky CompanyAccount, Kaspersky Endpoint Security Cloud, etc.), which enables users to manage their protection remotely. Email addresses are used to send security messages to (e.g., containing important alerts) to users of Kaspersky Lab products. Users can also choose to specify the names (or nicknames) by which they would like to be addressed on the My Kaspersky portal and in emails. Contact information is provided by users at their own discretion.

* Dump and trace files
By checking the special box in the product settings, users can also share error reports with Kaspersky Lab servers. This information helps (1) during analysis of errors that occurred in the product and to modify it accordingly so that it will function more effectively moving forward, and (2) in the investigation of infection of a user's computer in order to mitigate threats to a user's system.

* Emails
During your use of the anti-spam functionality, Kaspersky Lab scans emails and uses information about them to protect you from spam and fraud. When you indicate to Kaspersky that an email is spam or has been incorrectly identified by the software as spam, you help us analyze it and enable a higher quality of protection for users.

* Data about stolen device
The Anti-theft feature provides certain remote access and control functions designed to protect data on your mobile phone in case of theft, as well allows you to receive information about the location of the stolen device. Anti-theft has to store data about your phone and approved users for these functions to work.

* Data for child protection feature
If a parent or holder of parental responsibility wants to use the child protection feature like Kaspersky Safe Kids, he or she can receive information about the child's device and information about the child's location. Additionally, the parent or holder of parental responsibility can configure parameters in order to block or permit specific websites and/or allow or prevent certain applications from running on the child's device. Kaspersky Lab does not collect children's data beyond the framework of such feature.

* Unique identifier of the mobile device
This device identifier is generated on user device on Android 8 and higher, using the Advertising ID of the device. We do not process the Advertising ID in clear text; we process only its hash sum. In case user has reset the value of the Advertising ID, the new value of the unique identifier of the mobile device will be associated with the old value, which is necessary for the correct use of the device with services.

KASPERSKY LAB WILL ONLY PROCESS PERSONAL DATA FOR PARTICULAR, PRE-DETERMINED PURPOSES THAT ARE LEGITIMATE WITH REGARD TO APPLICABLE LAW, AND THAT ARE RELEVANT TO KASPERSKY LAB'S BUSINESS.
* To ensure the performance of a contract with users and to ensure the required performance of products and services for customers.
* To protect the user from known threats to information security.
* To verify that the license is legal.
* To update the anti-virus databases.
* To increase the effectiveness of the protection of devices, networks, and information systems, in particular to provide a faster response to new information and network security threats, to increase the effectiveness of the performance of the software's protection component, to decrease the probability of false positive.
* To improve user interaction and experience with our products and services, in particular changing interfaces and providing the desired content and advertisement, related to Marketing purpose.
* To provide technical support of products and services for customers and to improve the quality of products and services.
* To conduct statistical and other studies based on anonymous data.

Threat Intelligence for Protection of Cyber Space
New generations of malware appear all the time, many using new, sophisticated techniques to bypass existing security solutions. In this constantly shifting environment, protection is only as effective as the ability to closely analyze the threat landscape and distill data into actionable intelligence for our users. To achieve this, security solutions must apply a cloud approach that combines the widest possible scope of threat data handling with the most intelligent data processing technologies.
Our infrastructure is designed to receive and process complex global cyberthreat data, transforming it into the actionable threat intelligence that powers our products. A key source of threat-related data comes from our users. By sharing their data and allowing it to be stored and analyzed by artificial intelligence and experts, they help us to ensure that users around the world are protected against the newest cyberthreats. In particular, KSN helps us to respond rapidly to emerging cyberthreats while delivering the highest possible effectiveness of protection and helping reduce the number of false positives.
The amount of data you allow our infrastructure to receive depends on the product used, its configuration settings and preferences.
This approach offers numerous benefits for users and cyber space overall, including:
* Detection of advanced and previously unknown malware;
* Reduced detection errors (false positives);
* Significant reduction in response times to new threats.

Legal Bases for Data Processing
The legal basis we use depends on the purpose of processing personal data, which may be the following:
* Contract - according to point (b) of Article 6 (1) GDPR, in cases where we have to process certain data necessary to perform a contract, such as when a user accepts the EULA to use the software;
* Consent - according to point (a) of Article 6 (1) GDPR, in cases where a user chooses to send us data relating to the KSN Statement, Marketing Statement, Antispam Statement, Supplemental Statement, Statement regarding Data Processing for Kaspersky Managed Protection, Statement regarding Data Processing for Web Control (previously called Statement regarding Data Processing for Parental Control), Statement regarding Data Processing for Call Filter, Protect a Friend Statement, or Technical Support Statement;
* Legal obligation - according to point (c) of Article 6 (1) GDPR, in cases where we have to process data to meet legal requirements, such as for tax purposes;
* Legitimate interest - according to point (f) of Article 6 (1) GDPR, in cases where we have legitimate interests as a cybersecurity company, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the user. In such cases, for example, where personal data is stored in our infrastructure and analyzed for recent and potential cyberthreats by using artificial intelligence and/or relying on the expertise of our specialists. Recital 49 of the GDPR acknowledges that it is a legitimate interest of a company to process personal data to the extent necessary and proportionate in order to ensure network and information security.
